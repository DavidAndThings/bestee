Have you ever wondered whether there's a new and more lightweight approach to build chatbots? Well you've come to the right place. 
Bestee, unlike LLM driven bots, is a novel chatbot based off a deterministic architecture, meaning the system operates on a pre-defined algorithm. The algorithm itself defines a set of very simple APIs to allow developers to implement any set of functionalities, from simple to complex, from big to small. This essentially allows, when tackling NLP problems, a seemless integration of both classical rule-driven NLP approaches and more modern machine-learning driven modelling methods.
