Have you ever wondered whether there's a new and more lightweight approach to build chatbots? Well you've come to the right place. 
Bestee, unlike LLM driven bots, is a novel chatbot based off a deterministic architecture, meaning the system operates on a pre-defined algorithm. The algorithm itself defines a set of very simple APIs to allow developers to implement any set of functionalities, from simple to complext, from big to small. This essentially allows the seemless integration of both the classical rule-driven and the more modern machine-learning driven approaches.
